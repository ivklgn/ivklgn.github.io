        <h2>Hotpot Tracker – Experimental Project and Goal Management System</h2>
        <blockquote>Russian version available <a href="hotpot-tracker-mvp-ru.html">here</a></blockquote>

        <p>
          Hotpot Tracker is an experimental system designed to explore improvements to project/goal management tools
          such as Jira, Trello, Asana, and others. The project concept combines familiar features with what I believe to
          be breakthrough ideas for optimizing task management, visualization, and control.
        </p>

        <p>Main objectives of the experiments:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Navigation and search:</strong> How can we quickly find relevant tasks while retaining the "task
            board" paradigm?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Increasing team engagement:</strong> What do existing systems lack to prevent users from migrating
            to chats?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What defines a "Task"?</strong> A new perspective on this familiar term opens new possibilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Optimizing communication:</strong> How can task-related communication be made easier and clearer?
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Concept</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <strong>Disclaimer:</strong><br />
          This system intentionally avoids complex features like timelines or performance reports, focusing instead on
          other productivity-boosting aspects.
        </blockquote>

        <ol>
          <li>Multiple boards instead of one</li>
          <li>Attributes for boards and tasks instead of folders</li>
          <li>Everyone can participate</li>
          <li>Approvals instead of task status transition rules</li>
          <li>Linked attributes</li>
          <li>Remarks instead of comments <sup>in development</sup></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Multiple Boards Instead of One</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of managing everything on a single overloaded board, you can create separate boards for different
          goals and tasks. In my experience, many companies using Kanban/Scrum often rely on a single team board with
          goals represented as epics or milestones.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Screenshot: Example interface with multiple boards</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          <strong
            >Managing parallel processes on a single board increases task management complexity and cognitive load for
            the team.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <strong>Idea:</strong><br />
          Each employee or team creates their own boards tailored to their needs, simplifying navigation and management.
          For example, one board could be for ongoing tasks, another for long-term objectives (OKRs), and another for
          incident management.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Creating boards should be quick and easy—any team member can set up a board as needed. Multiple boards
          shouldn’t be intimidating, as each can be opened independently to maintain focus during discussions and work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Systems like Sentry or Graylog offer inspiration on how search and filtering can be effective. In Hotpot
          Tracker, filtering boards is simple and efficient using attributes, though task-level search is not yet
          implemented.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="./images/filter-preview-ru.png" alt="Boards filtering" />
          <figcaption>Screenshot: Board filtering</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Attributes for Boards and Tasks</h3>
        <p>Hotpot Tracker is built around three core entities:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Task</strong> – title, content, attributes, and a reference to a column. In Hotpot Tracker, a task
            is primarily treated as a document.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Column (Stage)</strong> – status, participants, and a reference to a board.</li>
          <li><strong>Board</strong> – name.</li>
        </ol>

        <blockquote>
          <strong>Idea:</strong><br />
          A unified attribute system for boards and tasks creates a consistent interface for editing meta-information.
          Hotpot does not impose predefined attributes on users.
        </blockquote>

        <figure>
          <img src="./images/properties-preview-ru.png" alt="Properties Preview" />
          <figcaption>Screenshot: Board attributes</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>This approach solves two problems:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Finding tasks is easier using attribute filters.</li>
          <li>Attributes simplify management by making it clear who is responsible for tasks and their deadlines.</li>
        </ol>

        <blockquote>
          <strong>Idea:</strong><br />
          Board attributes are automatically inherited by tasks. For example, if a board has a "Team" attribute, the
          tasks on that board will display the same attribute.
        </blockquote>

        </figure>

        <h3>Everyone Can Participate</h3>
        <p>
          By 2024, it became clear that product management and development are moving in the same direction but operate
          differently. Product representatives often don't participate directly in development, complicating requirement
          management. A valuable improvement is functionality that allows indirect participation through boards.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="./images/contributors-preview-ru.png" alt="Contributors Preview" />
          <figcaption>Screenshot: Managing contributors in columns (stages)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <blockquote>
          <strong>Idea:</strong><br />
          <strong>Stage = Status + Participants.</strong> Each column can be linked to specific participants, such as
          assigning reviewers or approvers.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          This feature rethinks the collaboration approach, inviting product or analytics representatives to contribute
          within technical teams.
        </p>

        <h3>Approvals Instead of Status Transition Rules</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <strong>Idea:</strong><br />
          Instead of complex status transition rules (like in Jira), Hotpot Tracker uses a simple approval system.
        </blockquote>

        <figure>
          <img src="./images/approves-preview-ru.png" alt="Approves Preview" />
          <figcaption>Screenshot: Task approvals</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Approvals make the process flexible and transparent, similar to GitLab’s review system, where changes are
          approved before completion.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Screenshot: Pending task approvals on the board</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Linked Attributes</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <strong>Idea:</strong><br />
          Task attributes (e.g., deadlines, priorities) can be linked to specific contributors.
        </blockquote>

          <figcaption>Screenshot: Assigning contributors to attributes</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Remarks Instead of Comments <sup>in development</sup></h3>
        <p>
          Traditional comments often create noise. Hotpot Tracker replaces them with remarks tied to specific task
          parts, similar to inline comments in version control systems like GitLab.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>Based on the goals of the experiments, I can conclude the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Navigation and search:</strong> How can we quickly find the necessary tasks while staying within the
            "task board" paradigm?
            <p>
              Attributes for boards/tasks may provide a more convenient UX than full-text search or arranging
              boards/tasks into different spaces.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Increasing employee engagement:</strong> What do current systems lack that causes users to resort to
            chats?
            <p>
              The ability to assign participants (contributors) to columns allows involving the right people for
              collaborative decision-making.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What is a "Task"?:</strong> A different perspective on such a familiar term opens up new
            possibilities.
            <p>
              A task is a document + attributes + approval. The focus should be on working on the task's content (its
              completeness and accuracy), rather than treating the task as a mere formality.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Optimal communication:</strong> How can we make task-related communication simpler and clearer?
            <p>
              Moving from regular comments to discussions tied to the task's text will increase the value of
              communication.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
